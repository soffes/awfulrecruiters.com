      <p>This used to be a list of third party recruiters. This was on the website:</p>
      <blockquote>I am definitely not saying these companies are awful. Simply that they are a source of undesirable email. This site is simply a list of domains. No claims are being made about the owners or their intentions.</blockquote>
      <p>Ideally, it was just a list of third-party recruiters. “Awful” was intended to be humorous. Some people over reacted a bit. Instead of constantly trying to explain myself, I think it's best to just remove the list. The whole point was to get less email. It's easier to ignore irrelevant job emails than empty legal threats.</p>
