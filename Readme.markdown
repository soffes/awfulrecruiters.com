# Awful Recruiters

I'm starting to compile a list of domains of recruiters. The goal is to get less email that I would never read anyway.

## Running Locally

Simply run the following commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/samsoffes/awfulrecruiters.com.git
    $ cd awfulrecruiters.com
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rackup config.ru

Enjoy.
